# Password-Generator
This is a basic password generator. Enjoy!

In this password generator I made an algorithm that assembles a random set of values plus a combination of a few arrays to make up the password itself. You can click the 'GENERATE PASSWORD' button to generate a password. I used math.random and math.floor to randomly select characters from their arrays to be used in the password.

I just noticed in the readme I did not meet all acceptence criteria. Specifically with prompting the user and storing their values from the prompt. Ive searched around on the web and I need to find or figure a solution of how to restore what the user typed to put into logic to meet the selection based criteria.

This password generator does generate upper case, lower case, numbers, symbols, and special characters in its password.

There is no set character length for the entire password.
There is no set selection method for choosing any specifics in choosing to make up the password requirements. I will have to resubmit this excercise to meet that criteria.

If we can use a html form that would work better than on screen javascript prompts.
